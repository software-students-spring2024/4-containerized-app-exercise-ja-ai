# Containerized App Exercise

# Project Description

Our project utilizes ML to estimate the age of a user. Through our web app, the user can take and upload a photo to be analyzed, then get an estimated age back and see how accurate the program is.

Build a containerized app that uses machine learning. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.
